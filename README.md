Hello there!
I am Tanisha Salvi, roll no. 210101103, branch CSE.
I am from Ranchi, Jharkhand.
My hobbies include poetry writing, reading and painting. I often talk in metaphors and like my puns intended.

I have been developing interest in open source programming and would very much like to explore the area.
Open source aims at solving real world problems, by being publicly accessible for contributions, and I hope to contribute in the foresaid field.
